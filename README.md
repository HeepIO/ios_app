# Swift!

This is a basic Swift Serverless Heep Implementation. Initially this will serve as a basic portal to send control values to online Heep Devices. In the long run, we will need a way to define and edit vertices as well - ideally using our favorite visual programming interface.

### Requirements
1. Mac (or Hackintosh)
2. Xcode 8
3. [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

### Installation
1. `~$ sudo gem install cocoapods`
2. `mobile_ios$ pod install`
